# KGraphify
KGraphify is a Python library that automatically extracts information from PDF documents and builds a knowledge graph in Neo4j, using a user-defined schema. The library leverages large language models (LLMs) to understand and structure the content of the PDF into a graph format compatible with Neo4j.

## Features
PDF Parsing: Extract text from PDF files, preserving structure and key entities.
Schema Mapping: Define your own schema to structure the graph nodes and relationships.
Graph Creation: Automatically generates a knowledge graph in Neo4j.
LLM Integration: Uses language models to interpret and categorize extracted content into the graph format.
